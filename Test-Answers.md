# QUESTIONS

## 1. How long did you spend on the test?

It took like 8hrs to finish the test, in which 3 of them I spent tried to solve the cors error consuming the API. Besides that, what took more time was creating and styling the UI.

## 2. What would you add if you had more time?

Improve the UI

## 3. How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume?

Actually I couldn't consume the API because of CORS error. I tried to use a proxy, change browser, but nothing worked. So, I would add cors in the api.

## 4. What did you find most difficult?

Consuming the API!

## 5. How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us?

I hope this test will be a good oportunity to show my developing skills!
